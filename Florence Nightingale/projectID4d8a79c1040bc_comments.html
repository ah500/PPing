<p>This is a Newcomers Only/Rapid Review project. Once P1 has completed, the book will move quickly into P2 as a Rapid Review project. As soon as P2 completes, each P1 will receive a computer-generated report of the P2 diffs generated.</p>

<td class='g'><p>Marking hyphenated words, e.g., to-*day, round-*house or post-*office, is always acceptable. Please leave previously marked end-of-line uncertain hyphenation (-*) alone--I have automatic scripts to handle them during PPing, so the more the merrier.</p>

<td class='g'><p>When chapters start with poems or quotes, please mark with /# or /* as usual, and put the 2 blank lines after the poem/quote.</p>

<p>Please use &lt;f&gt; to markup regular text within an italic phrase. For example:<br />
<i>This is an </i>Italian<i> poem.</i><br />
&lt;i&gt;This is an &lt;f&gt;Italian&lt;/f&gt; poem.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
